# asiair - patch_for_rpi.sh

Disclaimer - under US LAW youre entitled to perform an repair of your device (Magnusonâ€“Moss_Warranty_Act), meaning if your processor broke and you want to run your legally obtained ASIAIR/Seestar on a fixed/replaced board this is currently failing due to a version/cpuid check in the SW.

However the patch does inject a "fake" licence file (which actually inernally failed the SSL decryption), combined with a still matching and fake /proc/cpuinfo (overriden by a bind-mount from a file). Last step was patching the binary by returning internally in the execution flow "true" for the hardware verification step. By doing so the SW should be able to run on a replaced CPU. Run this application on the rw-mounted os. Backups of all files *should* be created. However all on your own risk and legal responsibility.
